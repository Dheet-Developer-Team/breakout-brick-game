## How we built it?
1. We divided the project into three parts
  * Physics Engine
  * Game UI
  * Landing Page
2. The player has 3 lives to complete the level
3. Added sound for collision of ball with paddle and bricks

## Challenges and how we fixed it: 
1. We had some bugs in our game engine due to which the ball was getting stuck at the edges.
  * We fixed by taking into account the width of the ball at the edges.
2. We has some difficulty in controlling the paddle through the mouse input.
  * We used the mouse function which we searched in the MDN docs which suited our needs.

*Hope you enjoy the game ! ðŸ§±*
